# Introduction
This is a simple example of how to use Anon Aadhar and Core DAO for a simple use case of a voting system. The voting system is a simple system where a user can vote for a proposal. The proposal with the most votes wins.

```contracts``` folder of the repository contains the smart contracts for the voting system. The smart contracts are written in Solidity. The smart contracts are deployed on the CoreDAO testnet using remix IDE.

```main-app``` folder of the repository contains the code for the Nextjs App for the voting system. The client code is written in JavaScript. The client code interacts with the smart contracts deployed on the CoreDAO testnet.
